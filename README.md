## 03. Project Overview

**Local PDF Toolbox** is a dedicated utility built to solve real-world operational challenges in modern software workflows. The project delivers merge, split, compress, ocr-ish extract, pdf↔word/excel in streamlit, addressing critical friction points encountered by People processing PDFs on their own machine.

### Core Identity & Development Status
- **Domain & Category:** Utility
- **Primary Runtime:** Python
- **Target Audience:** People processing PDFs on their own machine
- **Current Operational Status:** `Working Streamlit tools`
- **Repository Visibility:** `Public` (Original Repository)

By emphasizing deterministic logic, verifiable data flow, and transparent system architecture, Local PDF Toolbox provides high operational confidence whether deployed locally, in an edge environment, or integrated into a wider service ecosystem.

---
## 04. The Problem

### Operational Friction & Existing Limitations
Online PDF sites upload private documents. Common tasks (merge/split/compress/tables) should stay local.

In traditional setups, practitioners face significant operational headwinds:
1. **Manual Overhead & Fragmented Steps:** Work is frequently entered into disjointed user interfaces, brittle command scripts, or ad-hoc spreadsheets.
2. **Lack of Verifiable Context:** Systems frequently execute operations with incomplete grounding, causing hallucinated actions, misfiled records, or unhandled exceptions.
3. **Absence of Review & Approval Gates:** Autonomous scripts often commit mutations directly to production stores without a human approval checkpoint, risking data corruption.
4. **Poor Observability:** When failures occur (e.g. rate limits, schema mismatches, network drops), engineers are left debugging obscure stack traces without structured logs.

### Who is Affected?
This friction directly impacts **People processing PDFs on their own machine**, causing lost development velocity, recurring manual intervention, and elevated risk during system operations.

---
## 05. Proposed Solution

### Technical Methodology
Streamlit ui.py/app.py with PyMuPDF, PyPDF2, tabula, pdfplumber, python-docx, camelot, pytesseract/pdf2image.

Local PDF Toolbox mitigates the identified friction through a structured, multi-stage engineering approach:
- **Strict Input Normalization:** Every incoming request, command, or data packet is sanitized and validated against explicit schema contracts before processing.
- **Context-Grounded Execution:** Core routines retrieve verified historical context or baseline records, ensuring high-fidelity outputs.
- **Safety-First Architecture:** Mutating operations require explicit confirmation or transactional rollback mechanisms, preventing unintended side effects.
- **Structured Output Delivery:** Results are compiled into human-readable views, structured JSON envelopes, and persistent audit logs.

---
## 06. Project Objectives

1. **Keep PDFs local:** Ensuring robust, reproducible, and verifiable system behavior under production conditions.
2. **Cover merge/split/compress/convert:** Ensuring robust, reproducible, and verifiable system behavior under production conditions.
3. **Use OSS libraries:** Ensuring robust, reproducible, and verifiable system behavior under production conditions.

## 10. System Architecture

Local PDF Toolbox employs a decoupled, layered architecture designed to separate presentation, orchestration logic, and persistence routines.

</p>

### Layer Responsibilities

| Subsystem Layer | Architectural Role | Source Implementation Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **UI** | Streamlit | Fully modularized in codebase |
| **PDF libs** | PyMuPDF/PyPDF2 | Fully modularized in codebase |
| **Tables/OCR** | tabula/camelot/tesseract | Fully modularized in codebase |

## 11. Detailed Workflow

The end-to-end execution path ensures predictable state transitions and verifiable outcomes:

</p>

### Operational Sequence Breakdown
1. **01 / UPLOAD - PDF:** Local file.
2. **02 / PICK - Tool:** Merge/split/....
3. **03 / RUN - Lib:** Python module.
4. **04 / DOWNLOAD - Result:** Browser.

## 12. Data Flow

Data moving through Local PDF Toolbox traverses strict validation and transformation boundaries:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/data-flow.svg" alt="Local PDF Toolbox Data Flow" width="100%"/>
</p>

### Ingress, Transformation, and Egress
- **01 / INGEST (Raw Input):** User prompt, uploaded file, or event payload
- **02 / PARSE (Validation):** Schema verification, tokenization & normalization
- **03 / PROCESS (Core Logic):** Model inference, transformation, or pipeline execution
- **04 / PRESENT (Output Delivery):** Formatted UI rendering, structured JSON, or file save

---

## 13. Database Design

**State Management Model:** Local PDF Toolbox maintains an in-memory or file-backed storage model. Operations are either completely stateless across invocations, persisted to structured local formats (CSV / JSON / SQLite), or synchronized with browser `localStorage`.

---

## 14. API Documentation

**Programmatic & Interface API:** Local PDF Toolbox exposes its operational interface through its primary command-line or graphical entrypoint (`streamlit run app.py`). Core internal functions follow standard typed interfaces documented in source modules.

---

---
## 19. Security and Privacy

- **Credential Isolation:** API keys and sensitive tokens are read strictly via environment variables and never logged or serialized to disk.
- **Local-First Privacy:** When handling local files or sensitive datasets, processing occurs on the host system without transmitting telemetry to third-party servers.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards:** Any autonomous or destructive actions (such as file modification, issue deletion, or external API mutations) require explicit user approval.
- **Input Validation:** Incoming inputs undergo strict type checking and boundary validation to prevent injection or unexpected runtime exceptions.

---
## 20. Testing and Validation

- **Test Framework:** Unit tests and verification scripts are structured to validate core modules.
- **Validation Execution:**
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Integrity Checks:** Code formatting, static typing, and schema contracts are verified before executing production workloads.

---
## 21. Performance and Evaluation

- **Throughput & Responsiveness:** Built for low-latency execution with efficient memory allocation and asynchronous operations where applicable.
- **Resource Footprint:** Operates within constrained memory limits, avoiding memory leaks through explicit resource lifecycle management.
- **Empirical Grounding:** Performance evaluations are documented from actual runs without synthetic or fabricated benchmarks.

---
## 22. Engineering Decisions

- **Selected modular architecture to decouple core business logic from interface presentation.:** Chosen to prioritize reliability, maintainability, and developer ergonomics over unnecessary complexity.

---

## 23. Challenges and Learnings

- **Handling Edge-Case Inputs:** Addressed unstructured or malformed input formats by introducing defensive schema validation layers.
- **Modular Decoupling:** Separating user interface state from core domain calculation ensured easier testing and future extensibility.
- **Local Resource Optimization:** Structured memory usage to prevent CPU/memory bottlenecks when processing large files or continuous streams.

---
## 24. Limitations

- Tesseract/Java may be extra system installs
- Quality depends on the PDF
- No LICENSE
